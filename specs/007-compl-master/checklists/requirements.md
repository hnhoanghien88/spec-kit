- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Notes

- All items pass. This spec merges what were originally two separate feature specs (`007-compl-master-alert-type` for Create/Edit, `008-compl-master-alerttype-column` for the list column) into one, since both describe a single coherent capability. User Story 3 (list column) depends on User Stories 1/2 having already introduced the Alert type value.
